# Clean the build outputs for one configuration, robustly.
#
# Why not "make .clean-conf"? The MPLAB X IDE background service (mplab_backend)
# keeps file handles on build/<conf>/production/_ext/* directories even after the
# IDE window is closed. GnuWin32 "rm -rf" then aborts with "Permission denied" on
# those directories (exit 1), which also breaks the Rebuild sequence.
#
# This script deletes all output FILES (the functional clean) and only best-effort
# removes the directories, tolerating empty dirs that the backend still holds (those
# are harmless and recreated on the next build). It fails only if real output files
# stay locked.
#
# Invoked by the "MPLAB: Clean" task with cwd = the MPLAB X project directory (firmware.X).
# Configuration overridable via MPLABX_CONF.
