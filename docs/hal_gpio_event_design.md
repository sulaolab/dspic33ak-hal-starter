# GPIO CN Event Design

This note describes the small GPIO Change Notification (CN) event layer used by
the `gpio-event-sw3-validation` branch. It is an experiment for real hardware
validation, not a production-grade GPIO driver.

## File Split

- `src/hal/dspic33ak_gpio.h` and `src/hal/dspic33ak_gpio.c` remain the GPIO core.
  They handle ANSEL, TRIS, LAT, PORT, ODC, CNPU, and CNPD.
- `src/hal_gpio/dspic33ak_gpio_event.h` and
  `src/hal_gpio/dspic33ak_gpio_event.c` provide the CN event layer above the
  existing GPIO pin representation.
- `src/app/led_sw.c` owns the validation example and the `_CNBInterrupt()` vector.
- `firmware.X/nbproject/configurations.xml` includes
  `../src/hal_gpio/dspic33ak_gpio_event.c` in the MPLAB X build and adds
  `..\src\hal_gpio` to the C include path.

## API

The current event API is intentionally small:

```c
bool dspic33ak_gpio_event_attach(dspic33ak_gpio_pin_t pin,
                                 dspic33ak_gpio_event_edge_t trigger,
                                 dspic33ak_gpio_event_callback_t callback,
                                 void *user_data);

bool dspic33ak_gpio_event_detach(dspic33ak_gpio_pin_t pin);

void dspic33ak_gpio_event_process_isr(void);
```

Phase 1 accepts `DSPIC33AK_GPIO_EVENT_EDGE_EITHER` for `attach()`. The enum also
contains `FALLING` and `RISING` because callbacks report the detected edge, but
single-edge attach policy is intentionally deferred until the dsPIC33AK
`CNEN0x`/`CNEN1x` polarity mapping is finalized.

## ISR Ownership

The HAL event layer does not define interrupt vectors. The application or
example owns the vector and forwards to the event dispatcher:

```c
void __attribute__((__interrupt__, __no_auto_psv__)) _CNBInterrupt(void)
{
    dspic33ak_gpio_event_process_isr();
}
```

This keeps the HAL reusable for different applications that may choose different
CN ports, priorities, nesting rules, or interrupt routing.

## CN Flag Ownership

`dspic33ak_gpio_event_process_isr()` owns cleanup for pins registered through
the event layer:

- It reads the per-port `CNFx` pending bits.
- It handles only bits registered by `dspic33ak_gpio_event_attach()`.
- It clears the handled `CNFx` bits.
- It clears the matching port interrupt flag, such as `CNBIF` through the port's
  `IFSx` register mask.

The application still owns interrupt setup. For the SW3 validation path,
`led_sw_init()` clears `_CNBIF`, sets `_CNBIP`, and enables `_CNBIE` after SW3 is
configured and attached.

## Edge Detection

`attach()` captures the current `PORTx` level as `previous_high` before enabling
CN for that pin. During `dspic33ak_gpio_event_process_isr()`:

1. The dispatcher reads the current `PORTx` level.
2. Each pending registered pin compares current level with `previous_high`.
3. A high-to-low transition reports `DSPIC33AK_GPIO_EVENT_EDGE_FALLING`.
4. A low-to-high transition reports `DSPIC33AK_GPIO_EVENT_EDGE_RISING`.
5. The saved `previous_high` level is updated before the callback runs.

For the board's active-low SW3 on RB2:

- falling edge = released high to pressed low = press = LED5 ON
- rising edge = pressed low to released high = release = LED5 OFF

The SW3 callback only updates volatile state. The main loop writes LED5, so the
callback stays small and does not directly touch LED outputs.

## What Attach Does Not Do

`dspic33ak_gpio_event_attach()` does not modify:

- ANSEL
- TRIS
- CNPU/CNPD
- PPS
- interrupt priority
- interrupt enable bits

The application must configure the pin as a digital input before attaching an
event. In the current validation app, `led_sw_init()` clears ANSEL, sets input
direction, and enables the pull-up for SW1, SW2, and SW3 before attaching the
SW3 event.

## Current Validation Behavior

- SW1 remains a polling input and drives LED7.
- SW2 remains a polling input and drives LED6.
- SW3 uses the CN event layer and drives LED5.
- SW3 is active-low.
- `_CNBInterrupt()` is defined in `src/app/led_sw.c`, not in the HAL.

Expected serial banner line:

```text
 LEDs: SW1/SW2 poll LED7/LED6; SW3 CN event drives LED5.
```

## Limitations

- Phase 1 supports `EDGE_EITHER` attach only.
- There is no debounce filtering.
- There is one callback slot per port bit.
- The event layer uses a single dispatcher that scans all supported CN ports.
- It does not arbitrate shared CN port ownership with unrelated code that also
  directly modifies `CNENx`, `CNFx`, or the same port interrupt flag.
- It does not check package-level pin availability.
- It does not configure analog protection or PPS ownership.

## Future Wrapper Mapping

This layer is a useful stepping stone for a future GPIO wrapper:

- `dspic33ak_gpio_pin_t` can remain the low-level pin handle.
- `dspic33ak_gpio_config()` maps naturally to pin initialization and direction.
- `dspic33ak_gpio_write()`, `toggle()`, `read()`, and `read_output()` map to
  output and input operations.
- `dspic33ak_gpio_set_pull()` and `set_open_drain()` map to optional pin
  attributes.
- `dspic33ak_gpio_event_attach()` can become the basis for event callbacks after
  edge policy, debounce, and ownership rules are defined.

Open decisions for a later wrapper layer:

- whether GPIO init should automatically force ANSEL to digital
- how analog-capable pins should be protected from accidental digital use
- how PPS ownership should be represented without moving PPS into the HAL
- whether pin handles should stay as packed `port + bit` values or use board
  enum IDs
- whether single-edge attach should be exposed before fully documenting
  dsPIC33AK `CNEN0x`/`CNEN1x` polarity
