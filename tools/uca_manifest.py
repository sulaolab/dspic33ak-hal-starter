# Per-word records. `compare_mask` excludes reserved/unimplemented bits so that

# value is erased today (FCP/FWDT) are marked expected="erased": recorded, not
# ignored.
#
# CLONING IS PER-WINDOW, NOT PER-WORD: the generator copies every byte PRESENT in
# the two P1 UCA windows (see CLONE_WINDOWS) and leaves erased bytes erased, so
# today FICD/FDEVOPT are cloned and FCP/FWDT are simply absent. There is
# deliberately no per-word "clone" flag: the verifier requires P1==P2 for EVERY
# word, so a word that became non-erased but was excluded from cloning would fail
# verification. Copying the whole window keeps the two partitions identical by
# construction, whatever a future #pragma config adds.
#
# compare_mask = union of documented bitfields for that word (0xFFFFFFFF if we
# intend an exact full-word compare because the word is either fully erased or
# fully specified). We keep exact-equality for identity checks (clone is byte-
# exact) and use the semantic masks below for the value assertions.
